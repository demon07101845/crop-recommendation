 





🌾 Harvest Hub – AI-Driven Agricultural Insights
Harvest Hub is a full-stack AI-powered web platform designed to help farmers make informed, data-driven agricultural decisions. By combining machine learning and computer vision techniques, the platform delivers real-time insights for:

✅ Crop Recommendation
📈 Crop Yield Prediction
🍂 Plant Disease Detection Live demo link : https://frontend-ankits-projects-4916b64e.vercel.app/
🚀 Key Features
🌱 Crop Recommendation
Recommends the most suitable crop based on environmental and soil parameters such as NPK levels, pH, temperature, humidity, and rainfall. → Model: Random Forest Classifier → Accuracy: ~96%

📊 Yield Prediction
Estimates the expected yield for a selected crop using historical and environmental data. → Model: Decision Tree Regression → Accuracy: ~85%

🩺 Plant Disease Detection
Detects plant diseases from leaf images using a Transformer-based deep learning model. → Model: Vision Transformer (ViT) → Training Data: 87,000+ images → Accuracy: ~92%

💡 Motivation
With agriculture being the backbone of many economies, Harvest Hub aims to harness the power of artificial intelligence and cloud computing to assist farmers in making smarter choices. Our goal is to build tools that are:

Accurate
Scalable
Easy to use
Impactful in real-world agricultural scenarios
This project was developed as part of an academic initiative to explore how AI can address practical challenges in farming and food production.
